# Awesome (and heavily documented) .files for an awesome Meteor / ECMA 6 developer

I highly recommend starting here:
* .vim-maps-idometeor.md - An easy to read guide to my Vim shortcuts (AWESOME BTW)
* .vim-notes-idometeor.md - Notes about my Meteor / ECMA 6 Vim setup & plug-ins (AWESOME)
* .vimrc - Super awesome Vim config for an esoteric Meteor / ECMA 6 developer such as myself :D
* .eslintrc - My Meteor / ECMA 6 ESLint config (npm install -g eslint-config-meteor)
* .jscsrc - My Meteor / ECMA 6 JSCS configuration file

Then maybe if you're bored:
* .csslintrc - Quick config for CSSLint to ignore .meteor/packages
* .ctags - Exuberant C-Tags settings for CSS, Less, Mardown & SCSS
* .editorconfig - My Meteor project editorconfig for editor's which support it
* .gitconfig - Just for backup
* .gitignore - Handy default settings for a Meteor project
* .inputrc - Bash in Vim mode ftw!
* .ssh - My public keys in case you need to give me access <3
* .tern-project - My default Tern project settings for Vim
* .vim - Locally installed packages, syntax checkers, etc (required for my .vimrc, no bundles)
* .xmonad - Just for backup (regular config & my old hexa-head config cuz it was big <3z [going for nine next!])
* .xprofile - Just for backup
* .xscreensaver - Just for backup
* scripts - Some bash scripts I find handy, not as plush as it used to be
* README.md - This!


In scripts there are a couple files which refer to remote hosts.  They are long dead, no security concern.  Just historical.
